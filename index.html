        <p class="quote">I have cared for eight handsome gentlemen by the names of Walnut, Dasher, Rocket, McQueen, Stanley, Mister, and Lapis. I can assure you that they were all the best boys I could ever ask for. They loved munching on dry pasta and drinking out of their water bottle as loud as possible. I had a lot of wonderful moments with those boys, and I will never forget any of them. </p>
